        <h1>Data Structure in Java – A beginner’s Guide</h1>
        <p>More than 70% of companies use Data Structures and Algorithms to filter candidates.
            <br><br>It is extremely crucial to learn Data Structures and Algorithms for cracking a job interview in a product-based company.
            <br><br> For the upcoming few minutes, we’ll learn about the need for data structures using Java programming language and why they are so important to get a job.
            <br><br>Thereafter, we’ll look at different types of data structures with real-life examples (yes, you will connect a lot!) and their syntax and algorithms in Java.           
            <br><br>Let’s deep dive in!</p>
        
        <h2>Why do we need to learn Data Structures in Java?</h2>
        <p>Imagine 3 different Scenarios </p>
        <ol>
            <li>If we give you a thick dictionary to find the meaning of the word “Aggrandize” but the dictionary is unsorted.</li>
            <li>If we give you a map to find a route for a famous restaurant, but the map is in tabular format with a location in its latitude and longitudinal measure.</li>
            <li>If we ask you to share your Birthday pictures, but your Gallery saves data randomly and not date-wise.</li>
                
        </ol>
        <p>In these situations, you have all the data that’s required, but the structure is absolutely inefficient and unorganized. 
           <br><br>Thus, to utilize data most efficiently it needs to be structured in a way that maximizes its readability. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A sorted Dictionary</li>
            <li>A plotted Map</li>
            <li>A linear stack of Photos </li>
        </ul>    
        <p>Computers work with a wide variety of data, including texts, images, videos, geospatial information, and much more. So even with brilliant computational power,
             the right kind of logical structure is a must for saving time and space for a Java application. </p>
          
        <h2>What is Java?</h2>
        <p>Java language is one of the most popular programming languages developed by Sun Microsystem in 1995. It is a platform-independent language and thus can run on billions of devices.
             It is an easy-to-understand language and proves to be an efficient mode for learning the implementation of Data Structures.
            <br><br> Data Structures in java are given high importance in interviews and coding rounds because it is the most basic concept in computer science 
            and having a good understanding is important to develop software in java with excellent performance and functionality.</p>

        <h2>What are Data Structures in Java?</h2>
        <p>Data Structure is an arrangement of data in a computer’s memory. It includes Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked lists, binary trees, hash tables, etc.
           <br><br>We use algorithms to manipulate the data in these structures in various ways, broadly inserting new data elements, deleting, searching, and sorting.
            <br><br> Let’s look at some significant structures used to store data.</p>

        <h2>Types of Data Structures in Java</h2>
        <p>Data structures are broad of two types,</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Linear data Structure – when they are stored linearly, as in Arrays, Linked List.</li>
            <li>Non-linear Structure – when data is structured in a non-linear way, as in Trees, Graphs. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let’s discuss each of them one by one.</p>
        <h2>Linear Data Structure</h2>
        <h3>Arrays</h3> 
        <p>In the recent past, there used to be a stack of Indexed cards that had information like the name, age, etc. of citizens. So when a new citizen was added,
             they were given a new indexed card. When there was the need to search, the index number was looked at and the card was drawn out. <br><br> 

            This is no longer used thanks to computers using the same concept named “Arrays”. <br><br>
            Arrays are used so widely that they are predefined in almost all languages. <br><br>        
            Here’s an example of an Array in JAVA and some mostly-used operations,</p>
            
           <h2> When to use Arrays</h2>
            <p>The size of the data is known</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Dealing with similar data types</li>
                <li>When you need to search from between.</li>
                 <li> Next, we learn about stacks and queues.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>More than being data structures they are created and used to carry out tasks and once completed, they are discarded.</p>
            <h2>Stacks</h2>
            <p>Remember the toy having Rings of increasing size on a rod? The ring from the middle could not be taken out. Only the top ring could be removed one at a time.

              <br><br>  That’s the structure of a Stack.
                
              <br><br>A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of  LIFO (Last In First Out) and allows the insertion and deletion only from the top.
                
              <br><br>The operation of inserting the (new) top element is called Push.
                
              <br><br>The operation of deleting the top element is called Pop.</p>

              <h3>Java program to implement Stack Operations :</h3>
              <h2>Queue</h2>
              <p>Queue works exactly like the waiting lines at ticket counters (but way more disciplined). The person first entering the queue gets the ticket first.
                 <br><br>The queue is a linear data structure that follows the principle of FIFO (First In First Out) and allows insertion from one side and deletion from the other.</p>
            
            
            <h3> Java program to implement queue :</h3>
            <h2>Linked list</h2>
            <p>Arrays are useful when we have continuous memory cells. But say we need to create a list of 5 elements, but there are 3 empty cells at one place and 2 empty cells at another. So the solution is to link them together. 

                <br><br>Let me give an example
                
                <br><br>Suppose a school plans a movie day for its students. When Booking the tickets, they found seats in one row itself. So the teacher notes the row and the first and the last seat number.
                
                <br><br>But suppose, the seats were available at different places. Now to remember where the students are seated, what the teacher does is, takes a paper and note down the seat number of Student 1. She then tells Student 1 to note and keep the seat number of Student 2. Student 2 to keep seat number of Student 3 and so on. Thus creating a Link among students. 
                
                <br><br>So after the show, when the teacher comes to collect them, she can go to Student 1, and then to Student 2, and so on.
                
                <br><br>This my friend, is a Linked List. 
                
               <br><br> A linked list is a connection of Nodes, where each node has two parts, one for storing the data and two for storing the link to the next node.</p>
            
            <h2> Non-Linear Data Structures</h2>
            <h2>Trees</h2>
            <p>Trees are widely used due to their efficiency in organizing and searching data.

                <br><br>Say for example, in a University database, I need to look for data of a Student. If the data is arranged in hierarchical form,
                
                <br><br>Trees are widely used due to their efficiency in organizing and searching data.
                
                <br><br>then I can quickly look at a branch, and find it easily without scanning other branches as in Array. This makes searching more efficient.
                
                <br><br>The tree data structure has a root node, branches, and sub-branches. The last nodes are called Leaves.
                
                <br><br>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Ut elit tellus, luctus nec ullamcorper mattis,
                 pulvinar dapibus leo.</p>
            
            <h2>Graphs</h2>
                <p>A graph is just like a Tree, a collection of objects (nodes/ vertices), connected through a set of Edges.
                
                    <br><br>Unlike trees, we have a set of vertices connected through edges connected in any way possible. There’s no defined structure or hierarchy.
                
                    <br><br> Major applications can be found in Google maps, Social networks, the world wide web, Blockchain, etc.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion-</h3>
